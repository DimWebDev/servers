# Model Context Protocol Servers

This repository contains a collection of *reference implementations* for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP), along with references to community-built servers and additional resources.

This work is based on the original [Model Context Protocol servers repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers), with particular inspiration drawn from its sequential thinking approach. Building upon that foundation, I have developed my own MCP servers and extended the protocol's capabilities.

For instructions on how to use the mcp servers, navigate to the `src` directory.
